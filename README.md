# Twootr

## Requirements

A product similar to Twitter.

Each micro-blog from a user would be called a twoot and users would have a constant stream of twoots. In order to see what other users were twooting about, you would follow those users.

- Users log in to Twootr with a unique user ID and password.
- Each user has a set of other users that they follow.
- Users can send a twoot, and any followers who are logged in should immediately see the twoot.
- When users log in they should see all the twoots from their followers since they last logged in.
- Users should be able to delete twoots. Deleted twoots should no longer be visible to followers.
- Users should be able to log in from a mobile phone or a website.
